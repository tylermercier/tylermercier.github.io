I read an interesting bit about debugging and thought it was worth sharing.

What I find interesting about this method is that I have done the same thing countless times. I will be telling my wife about my day and some problem I was having or explaining what I am working on to a friend and get one of those moments where describing the problem provides the solution.

Programming is fun.
