Came across a very easy to set up Django environment. No install, one file to download and only configuration for whatever you want to run as a configuration requirement. You can even set this up to run off of a flash drive, which I thought was pretty sweet.

[Instantdjango](http://www.instantdjango.com/) should be able to start you on your first django web app in under 30 mins on most windows machines with no other pre-requisites.

There is also a hand holding [guide](http://www.instantdjango.com/chapter1.html) from beginning to end targeted at very beginner level audience. Now back to tweaking my crime map.
