Intel has a set of guidelines available ([publically](http://www.intel.com/sites/sitewide/en_US/social-media.htm)) that are quite good. It breaks down into three key sections,

**When You Engage**

> Stick to areas that you are an expert in.
>
> Be respectful to the topic and others
>
> Be thoughtful about what you post
>
> Donâ€™t disclose proprietary or confidential information
>
> Be polite, especially when disagreeing with someone

**Moderation Guidelines**

> Breaks down different content sections and rules for each.

**Rules of Engagement**

> This is the most interesting and meaty section of the document. I recommend reading it [directly](http://www.intel.com/sites/sitewide/en_US/social-media.htm#rules).  </div>
