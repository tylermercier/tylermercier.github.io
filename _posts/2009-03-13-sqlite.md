While trying to play around with the cookies in firefox, I discovered that firefox uses SQLite to manage all its keys. This got me interested, what is this [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/)?

SQLite is an open source relational database that does not require a separate process to function. SQLite accomplishes this by storing data within a text file and accessing it through a common library. The applications for small projects, mobile apps, portable code, or prototyping become apparent and leave me wanting more information.

There is a full [Administration Console](http://sqliteadmin.orbmu2k.de/) (think SQL Server 2000 Query Analyzer). This makes working with the data much easier as it gives you the access you are probably familiar with.

I also found a [C# Wrapper (includes libraries)](http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/)&#160; that can be used to manage your own SQLite database.

One of the immediate drawbacks I noticed was that it does not support multi-threading as it is limited to disc IO directly.
