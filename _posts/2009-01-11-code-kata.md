Kata is a Japanese word describing detailed choreographed patterns of movements practiced either solo or in pairs. Code kata is the same principle. It can involve tasks like reading code, both good or bad, working on problems or anything else that will help you perfect your skill. Below are some useful links with problems to work on.

Some Code Kata I have been doing is with design patterns. In order to keep things interesting, I like to incorporate elements of what I enjoy (video games for instance) into the program I am creating. I find it helps keep the repetative programming interesting which keeps me focused and creative in my thinking
