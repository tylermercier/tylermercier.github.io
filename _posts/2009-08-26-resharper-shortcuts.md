I’ve been a huge fan of [ReSharper](http://blogs.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2009/03/resharper-45-beta-released/) since I first started using it almost 6 months ago. It takes time and effort to make the most of any tool and ReSharper is no different. That said, the benefits are paid back ten times over with a tool that rarely lets you down. As I’ll likely bring up ReSharper in the near future, I’d like to post my favorite shortcuts. I can look at features like live templates or issues like memory usage another time.

Key | Action
-- | --
Ctrl-Alt-T | Bring up unit test explorer
Ctrl-E | Lists files in order of last access
Ctrl-N / Ctrl-Shift-N | Open type / Open file (SystemInfo can be found by shortcut SI)
Alt-Shift-L | Moves focus to currently open file in the solution folder
Ctrl-Shift-G | “Super Go”, brings up usuage, declaration, base, more…
Alt-Insert | Code generation, constructor, implement interface, more…
Ctrl-Shift-R | Refactoring options, rename, move, extract, pull up, more…
Ctrl-F6 | Change method signature.
Ctrl-Shift-Alt-Arrow | Key	Move item up or down, including whole methods
Ctrl+F12 | member search
