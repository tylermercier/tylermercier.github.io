I have a terrible tendency to accumulate bookmarks and not get the chance to go back and properly implement or use the article in question. In this case, that has more to do with spending little or no time on my web skills (HTML/CSS/Javascrip) in the last three months. Sure I have done some web work, but my spare time has been primarily on other things.

The first is a monstrous link dump on CSS techniques including obvious css related topics such as Page Layout, Menu/Navigation, Typography and others. Now perhaps you are not [Max Kerning](http://www.maxkerning.com/) and typography doesn’t concern you more than life itself. Covering ways to avoid [click jacking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking) is also a good touch.

The second is something I came across after doing something similar myself. I’ve always disliked ASP.NET web forms, especially the XML tag soup and bloated code behind involved in forms validation (and most things). Something like [this](http://www.position-relative.net/creation/formValidator/) isn’t too difficult to implement, provides much more direct and immediate feedback to the user and can use server side validation to validate the data on the client side (validate it again just to be sure on submit though)

The last is very design centric, which is something I have never been very adapt at. Sure I can make something good, but it always feels like it takes longer than it should. Creating new sites from scratch is something I usually try to defer to something like [free-css-templates](http://www.freecsstemplates.org/). In any case, learning how to do this on your own is certainly a valuable skill when you cannot just reference someone else’s work and do away with hours of your own.
