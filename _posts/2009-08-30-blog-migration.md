What better way is there to spend a Sunday afternoon than migrating old data…

I am just happy that it is done. I’ve also migrated an old domain so that blogspot can use it. Enjoy viewing my blog from [codecuriosity.com](http://www.codecuriosity.com/) instead of [codecuriosity.blogspot.com](http://www.codecuriosity.blogspot.com/)
