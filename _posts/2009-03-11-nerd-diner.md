A new ASP.NET MVC example site was released yesterday. You can see it in action [here](http://nerddinner.com/) or download it from source forge [here](http://nerddinner.codeplex.com/) . It was put together by, Rob Conery, Scott Hanselman, Phil Haack and Scott Gunthrie. There is also a pdf document covering the entire creation of the site. The document is available [here](http://aspnetmvcbook.s3.amazonaws.com/aspnetmvc-nerdinner_v1.pdf) .

The MVC web application features OpenID, Localization, RSS feeds, Mobile version and heavy use of Virtual Earth's API (It is a microsoft product after all).

More importantly, there is also some pretty extensive testing with mocking (Moq framework) and the integrate microsoft unit testing framework.
