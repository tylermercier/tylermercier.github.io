Found a pretty awesome web application site. Aviary has an online image editor (Phoenix), vector editor (Raven), color swatches (Toucan) and number of tutorials on how to create visually appealing logos and images. There is also a large number of upcoming applications.

Hummingbird - 3D Modeller and skinner
Roc - Music generator
Starling - Video editor
Owl - Desktop publishing layout editor
Penguin - Word processor
Pigeon - Painting simulator
Horus - Font editor
Hawk - Digital content marketplace
Crane - Custom image product creator
Eagle - A smart online application that can identify complex data about an image based on the pixel patterns (i.e. which specific camera an image originally came from)
Woodpecker - Smart image resizer using seam carving (minitool)
Tern - Terrain generator (minitool)
