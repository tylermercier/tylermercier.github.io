Last week I was involved in some new employee code reviews and pairing interviews. Since most people that apply to <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks </a>do our Mars Rover problem, I decided that I should probably give the problem a try. The solution is pretty simple, which is probably why most people select this problem. I happened to be in a programming mood at the time, so I decided to make the problem a little more difficult.

Could I write a solution without an IF statement?

It turns out that I can and the results were very interesting. Here is the first cut of my spin left method before the change over.

```
// TODO

Here is another deviation with if statements, because you know... switches are smelly.

```
// TODO
```

Then here is what I came up with when trying to remove all my conditions.

```
// TODO
```
