Seems a lot of people recommend [live writer](http://download.live.com/writer) for blogging. This is probably old hat to anyone reading this, but I like saving information for my own sake sometimes.

Iâ€™ve also added the [code snippet plugin](http://wlwplugincollection.codeplex.com/) that is available on codeplex.
```
public static void SomeMethod()
{
    Func<int, int> sqrInt = x => x * x;
    Console.WriteLine(sqrInt(5));
}
```

Seems to work better than the other snippet tools that I have played with, but I wonder how it holds up to edits.
