I am ashamed to admit I never knew about the [sp_help](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa933429(SQL.80).aspx) and [sp_helptext](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms176112.aspx) commands in sql server until today. Why has no one ever shown me this earlier?

sp_help will find a stored proc by just providing its name. It will then show all the matches, where they are located and what parameters they take.

sp_helptext will something similar, expect it will display the actual stored procedure. Much easier than hunting through a list.
