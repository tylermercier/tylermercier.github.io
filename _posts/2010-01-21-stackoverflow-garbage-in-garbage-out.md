I have been using stackoverflow for over a year now. It surprises me how great the answers you can find there are and in some cases, the pure quality and effort some individuals will put into them. Take this iPhone&nbsp;[question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/569940/whats-the-best-way-to-communicate-between-view-controllers "question")&nbsp;for example.

A stackoverflow user is asking a question about the best way to pass data to ViewControllers in the iPhone (Which uses MVC for its UI). The top answer there is both informative and useful in that it provides a concise answer, as well as, example code to get the user started. Obviously this question took time out of someone else's day to think about and reply, then edit and update. Truly a wonderful example of the simple yet highly valuable resource stackoverflow can be.

Then you get questions like this&nbsp;[one](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2109969/c-is-there-a-way-to-classify-enums/2110065#2110065 "one"). I've seen that question both asked and answered over and over for years now. I've even asked it myself at one point and let me just say that providing an explicit answer to that question never did me any favors. The question is born out of looking for the wrong solution. The stackoverflow user, in this case, is looking for the wrong solution and getting it handed to him on a silver platter.

This is just like using a calculator, they always give you an answer, they don't always give you the right one. Stackoverflow is full of people eager to give you an answer to your question, but no one will spend the time questioning the origins of it.
